# Hightide

I started this project when I had just become familiar with Java-development, somewhere after the very first course I had taken on the subject.
The project's purpose was to help me get more familiar with programming in addition to helping me learn the Android-framework.
As a result, the coding is absolutely horrible in many departments, but I did learn a lot from working on the project, 
apart from it being a fun hobby. While the project did go through iterations of code improvement in parallel with my improvement as a developer,
I ultimately abandoned the project when I reached the point where I realized I'd be better off simply rewriting the entire application.

In conclusion,
for any potential employer viewing this documentation, please see that this level of coding was a very early point in my career, 
but admire my dedication using the very limited knowledge I had available to create a, arguably subjective, playable Android-game.
